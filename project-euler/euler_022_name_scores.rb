# Using names.txt  (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
# containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out
# the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value
# by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.

# For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN,
# which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list.
# So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.

# What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
